# Movie Recommendation System

This project provides a movie recommendation system using a Flask backend and an Angular frontend. The backend uses collaborative filtering with the Surprise library to generate recommendations based on a userâ€™s favorite movies. The Angular frontend provides a user-friendly interface to input favorite movies and display the recommended titles.

## Overview

## Features
